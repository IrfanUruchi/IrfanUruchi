# 👋 Hey there, I’m Irfan Uruchi

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys working on both hardware and software projects. Outside of my coursework I’ve:

- 📱 Launched **4 iOS apps**  
- 🤖 Fine‑tuned **7 custom LLMs**(one private)
-  🖥️ Assembled **2 computer architectures** from scratch  
- 💡 Exploring the intersection of software, hardware & AI
